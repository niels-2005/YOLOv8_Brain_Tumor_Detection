# YOLOv8_Brain_Tumor_Detection

Welcome to the **YOLOv8_Brain_Tumor_Detection** repository! This project utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture to detect brain tumors from medical imaging. By harnessing state-of-the-art object detection techniques, our goal is to provide a reliable tool for automated tumor detection, which can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and planning treatment.

## Project Overview

**YOLOv8_Brain_Tumor_Detection** uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze brain scans for tumor presence. The project leverages a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned on a curated dataset of brain images, to achieve high precision and recall.

### Data Preparation

The dataset includes images of brain scans from various sources, labeled for the presence of tumors. These images undergo several preprocessing steps to ensure model accuracy:
- Resizing images to uniform dimensions for model compatibility.
- Enhancing image contrast to highlight features relevant for tumor detection.
- Augmenting the dataset to improve model robustness under different conditions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Key activities in our exploratory data analysis include:
- Analyzing the distribution of tumor sizes and locations to understand patterns.
- Visualizing the balance between different classes to ensure model fairness and accuracy.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Our training process involves:
- Utilizing the YOLOv8 network, starting from a pre-trained checkpoint on general objects.
- Fine-tuning the model on our specific dataset to specialize it in detecting brain tumors.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across various thresholds.

### Finetuning

Fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model involves:
- Loading the pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- Adapting the model to our brain tumor detection task by adjusting layers specifically for our image sizes and classes.
- Training the model using a custom training loop with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Objectives

- **Improve Detection Accuracy**: Enhance the model's ability to accurately identify the presence of tumors in brain scans.
- **Optimize Model Performance**: Refine the model to be efficient and reliable in different operational environments.
- **Support Clinical Decisions**: Provide a tool that can assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Conclusion

The **YOLOv8_Brain_Tumor_Detection** project aims to advance medical imaging analysis through deep learning, providing a valuable tool for early and accurate tumor detection. It embodies our commitment to leveraging technology for better healthcare outcomes.
